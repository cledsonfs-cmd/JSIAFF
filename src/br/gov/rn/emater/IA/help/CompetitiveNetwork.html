    <h2>Competitive Network</h2>
    <p>Competitive learning is a form of unsupervised learning in artificial neural networks, in which neurons compete for activation - the right to respond to a subset of the input data.  The competition is done using inhibitory connections between neurons in competitive layer. It works by increasing the specialization of each neuron in the network, so each neuron will have maximum response for a particular input pattern. It is well suited for finding clusters within data.

	<p>The dots represent the input vectors, the crosses represent the weights for cach of three units. </p>
    <p>To create and train Competitive Network neural network with easyNeurons do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose Competitive Network architecture (in main menu choose Networks&gt;Competitive Network)</li>
      <li>Enter architecture specific parameters (number of neurons in input layer)</li>
      <li>Create training set (in main menu choose Training &gt;New Training Set)</li>
      <li>Train network </li>
      <li>Test network</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> To create Competitive Network
    network, in main menu click<strong> Networks &gt; Competitive Network</strong></p>

    <p><strong>&nbsp;Step 2.</strong> Enter number of neurons
    in input layer, and click <b>Create</b> button. </p>
    <p><img src="images/competitiveNetworkWizard.jpg" width="210" height="148"></p>
    <p>This will create the Competitive Network neural network
      with two neurons in input and four in output layer.</p>

    <p>Now we shall train this simple network, to learn from  data.
    First we have to create the training set</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3.</strong>Â  In main menu click <b>Training
  &gt; New Training Set</b> to open training set wizard.</p>
